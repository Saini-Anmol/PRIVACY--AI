"PrivacyAI", a technologically advanced browser extension designed to ensure responsible use of Generative AI, specifically OpenAI's ChatGPT, within organizational boundaries, policies, laws, and regulations. PrivacyAI is poised to play a pivotal role in revolutionizing the digital landscape.
Upon document upload, PrivacyAI utilizes Python's OCR library to preprocess scanned documents, facilitating seamless conversion to editable text. Following this, (SpaCy an NLP library) analyzes the text, extracting key elements to derive rules and regulations, which are then assigned using Python backend algorithms.In "PrivacyAI" we integrated Reinforcement Learning (RL), leveraging its suitability for dynamic environment tasks. Crucially, Reinforcement learning (RL) excels in Real-Time decision-making, allowing "PrivacyAI‚Äù to promptly adapt to evolving policies.

Our Chrome extension seamlessly integrates with a TensorFlow.js ML model, facilitating direct connectivity to SpaCy within the extension. User queries in ChatGPT trigger JavaScript's DOM analysis of search results, delivering valuable insights to the user. This involves thorough examination and extraction of relevant information.

Based on predefined criteria, weights, and extracted entities, the system assigns scores (1-10) to identified rules' harmfulness/relevance in the user's search query using backend Python code. The algorithm meticulously analyzes rules, assigning scores based on criteria matching degree.
Users are promptly alerted to potential risks or deceptive practices from search results via popup notifications, featuring corresponding risk scores. JavaScript, Chrome Extension APIs, and DOM manipulation facilitate these notifications. Risk scores are determined based on match severity, ensuring timely and informative alerts.
Upon continued disregard of alerts, JavaScript manipulates the DOM to highlight search box and results, emphasizing relevant text snippets. The system then dispatches SMS notifications via Twilio API to the user's mobile number and a government agency. This alert system proactively mitigates risks and escalates notifications in response to ignored popups or harmful data.
